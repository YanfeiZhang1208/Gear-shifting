Gear shifting in hyperthermophylic Archaea. | Yanfei Zhang, Hans V.Westerhoof | 2020|
The well characterized thermoacidophilic Sulfolobus solfataricus (S. solfataricus) thrives in extreme environments with temperatures between 60 and 90 °C and pH between 2 and 4. We here focus not so much on the challenge posed by each of these individual conditions, but by the challenge of the continuous variation of the challenges. In this study, we examine whether a phenomenon we call ‘gear shifting’ could be at play. We use the organism’s genome-wide metabolic map (Ulas et al., 2012), a thermodynamic analysis, and kinetic models based on parts of the metabolic map (Zhang et al., 2017) and focus on the various pathways from glucose to pyruvate as well as the different flux patterns through oxidative phosphorylation. Using flux balance analysis on the genome sequence-based metabolic map, we find a diversity of possible flux patterns with 8 different ATP yields. Using the transcriptome as basis, we find that also the expressed pathways allow for the operation of various parallel metabolic routes operating at different ATP costs or yields. This suggests that S. solfataricus may well run its metabolism through various metabolic pathways in parallel. In a non-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis, we show how transitions between flux patterns could be beneficial for the flux of ATP synthesis. We identify a mode of continuous variation of the ATP/catabolism stoichiometry that should be optimal for the organism if it is stressed energetically. The simulations with an in silico kinetic replica shows that the ATP/ADP ratio was indeed a strong determinant of the fluxes through the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plus phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) pathway and non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN) (the alternative to GAPDH plus PGK). With the increase of ATP/ADP value, the flux of GAPDH decreased, whilst the flux through GAPN increased monotonically. Flux balance analysis further shows that with this different pathway allocation the harvest of Gibbs energy or biomass changes. Likewise, at different oxygen concentrations different electron transfer pathways may be used to best achieve certain objectives according to FBA. We identify these phenomena as ‘gear shifting’, which should enable organisms’ to enhance their fitness under conditions of time-variant challenges.
